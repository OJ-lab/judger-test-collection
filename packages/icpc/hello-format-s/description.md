# Hello %s

Almost every programming language has a "Hello World" example.
So lets make it a little bit more interesting.

We need you let your program print "Hello %s" to the standard output.
The `%s` is a placeholder for a name.

## Input

The input contains a single line with a name. EX: `World!`

## Output

The output should be a single line with the text "Hello %s" where `%s` is the name from the input.

If the input is `World!` the output should be `Hello World!`.
